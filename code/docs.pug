        h2 Installation
        p To get Howdy onto your web form, you'll first need to #[a(href="/try-it") generate your own code snippet]. Using only your email address, we'll create you your own, unique code snippet; just like if you were installing Google Analytics.
        p When you've got your code snippet, paste it into the same HTML file as your form; it doesn't matter where, as long as it's in the same file. With the snippet in place, when the page is loaded Howdy will fire up, detect any forms on the page and handle submissions from them <i>automatically</i>.
        p The first time you submit your form with Howdy installed, we'll send you a confirmation email with a link to click. This is just to verify that you have access to the email inbox you're trying to make submissions to. After that you should see further submissions appear in your inbox.

        p <strong>Please note:</strong> Your Howdy account is associated with the email address you originally used to generate your snippet with. This is where we'll contact you with any correspondence, including account changes or payment invoices.

      .docs-section
        h2 Using a new email address
        p If you want to have your submissions go to a different email address from the one associated with your account, there's <strong>no need to generate a new snippet</strong>. Instead, simply adjust the <code>data-howdy-recipient</code> attribute on your existing snippet code. The first time you attempt to submit a form using new email we'll send you a confirmation email with a link to click. This is just to verify that you have access to the email inbox you're trying to make submissions to.

        p Below is an example of what your snippet might look like with an adjusted <code>data-howdy-recipient</code> attribute:

        pre
          code.language-html &lt;script src="https://static.howdyform.com/howdyClient.js?token=y0urT0k3n" data-howdy-recipient="another-email@gmail.com"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

        p With a standard Howdy account, you can send submissions to an unlimited number of different email addresses so you can change this as often as you want. However, remember you're limited to <strong>25 forms</strong> before you'll be asked to move to an enterprise account.


      .docs-section
        h2 Automatic validations
        p Howdy will automatically detect inputs with common names such as <code>telephone</code> and <code>email</code> and apply appropriate validations to them. Below is a full list of automatically validated <code>name</code> inputs:

        ul.attributes-list
          li <code>email</code>
          li <code>name</code>
          li <code>first_name</code>
          li <code>last_name</code>
          li <code>firstName</code>
          li <code>lastName</code>
          li <code>subject</code>
          li <code>topic</code>
          li <code>about</code>
          li <code>body</code>
          li <code>message</code>
          li <code>address</code>
          li <code>postcode</code>
          li <code>post_code</code>
          li <code>postCode</code>
          li <code>zipcode</code>
          li <code>zip_code</code>
          li <code>zipCode</code>
          li <code>tel</code>
          li <code>telephone</code>
          li <code>mobile</code>
          li <code>mob</code>
          li <code>age</code>
          li <code>dob</code>
          li <code>date_of_birth</code>
          li <code>dateOfBirth</code>

        p For example, the following form input would be automatically validated as a phone number:

        pre
          code.language-html &lt;input type="text" name="telephone" /&gt;

        p If you want to remove the default validation on an input, you can set a custom validation of type <code>none</code>. If you want to override the default validation on an input, you can set a custom validation of some other type. See the Custom validations section of this document for more information on using custom validations.

        p Error messages on erroneous inputs are inserted directly after the input and given a HTML class of <code>.erroneous</code> for you to style appropriately. Error messages are cleared next time the input is focussed.

      .docs-section
        h2 Custom validations
        p Howdy also supports adding your own custom validations to inputs. This can be done by adding a <code>data-howdy-validate</code> attribute to an input with one of the following possible validation values:

        ul.attributes-list
          li <code>none</code>
          li <code>required</code>
          li <code>email</code>
          li <code>number</code>
          li <code>date</code>
          li <code>tel</code>

        p For example, if you wanted to ensure an input was filled in, you could do this:

        pre
          code.language-html &lt;input type="text" name="favouritePet" data-howdy-validate="required" /&gt;

        p Error messages on erroneous inputs are inserted directly after the input and given a HTML class of <code>.erroneous</code> for you to style appropriately. Error messages are cleared next time the input is focussed.

      .docs-section
        h2 Supported input types

        p Howdy has no limit on supported HTML input types, with the exception of the ability to handle file uploads (we're working on it!). Generally speaking, any HTML input type that has a <code>name</code> property, Howdy should successfully be able to validate and retrieve a sensible value from for the submission messages delivered to your email inbox.
