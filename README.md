 3. Rename the cloned folder to create your new site

## Working with the project

The following commands all need to be run from the directory of your project, use `cd` to get there:
 
### Starting the project server

Once started, a browser window will open to the homepage of your site. Any changes to the `./code/` directory while the server is running will be automatically detected and trigger a rebuild of the sass/jade/js and cause the browser to refresh.

```
npm run start
```

### Running the tests (not yet implemented)

```
npm run test
```

### Forcing a rebuild of the code

```
npm run build
```
